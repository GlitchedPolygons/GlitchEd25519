As per the Zlib license used by this project, here are the changes
that I've applied, in order or importance/relevance:

* Moved header files into dedicated include directory.
* Added “ORLP_” prefix to declspec macro (to prevent possible collisions with other libraries making use of the same name).
* Added CMakeLists.txt and build.sh for easy packaging and inclusion into other projects.
* Deleted .dll files inside repo.
